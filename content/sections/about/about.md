Hi there! My name is Anup Sharma, I loves to build software solutions that power systems and devices. My passion for electronics and computers started at a very young age. Soon after I got my first computer, I started writing low-level codes, experimenting with microcontrollers and sensors which eventually turned my iterations into projects. When I began learning deep programming, I realized that a substantial portion of it was based on open source technology. This finding caught my interestin the open-source world and prompted me to delve deeper into its collaborative and community-driven approach. This was the beginning of in-depth learning for me with ‘the Linux OS/kernel’.
